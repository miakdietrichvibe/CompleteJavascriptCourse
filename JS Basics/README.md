# CompleteJavascriptCourse
Working through Jonas' Complete Javascript Course on Udemy

## Basics
* Testing -- Hello!
* Second Test!
* Got github to work with a new repository within VSCode all on my own--feelin' pretty proud! Also inserted Jonas' course code.
* Trying to figure out how to view a page in the browser and have it automatically update as I save files. Google'd something about 'gulp', but could not get it to install correctly. :\
* Marcus told me to go ahead and use extensions to view things in the browser! It does not update automatically, but it gets me going, which is more important. I also downloaded more extensions for formatting, project management, and autocompletion.
