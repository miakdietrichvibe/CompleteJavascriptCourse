Working through Jonas' Complete Javascript Course on Udemy

## Basics
* Testing -- Hello!
* Second Test!
* Got github to work with a new repository within VSCode all on my own--feelin' pretty proud! Also inserted Jonas' course code.
* Trying to figure out how to view a page in the browser and have it automatically update as I save files. Google'd something about 'gulp', but could not get it to install correctly. :\
* Marcus told me to go ahead and use extensions to view things in the browser! It does not update automatically, but it gets me going, which is more important. I also downloaded more extensions for formatting, project management, and autocompletion.
* == does type coercion, but === does not. When creating if/else statements, almost always use ===
* Remember, type coercion is when JS is able to consolidate different datatypes into one datatype. So the string `23` can be interpretted as the integer 23.
* Hold onto the vocabulary. The difference between a `statement` and an `expression` is that a statement simply performs an action, while an expression produces a value.
* `Methods` are functions related to arrays. I suspect methods are really a set of functions related to one thing... because I'm sure there are object methods as well.
* ES2015 is still too new to use in production, so we will stick with ES5.
